# -RecipeOrchestratorAPI
RecipeOrchestratorAPI is a Spring Boot-based backend application that loads recipe data from an external API (dummyjson.com/recipes) into an in-memory H2 database. It exposes RESTful APIs to search and retrieve recipes using free-text queries (on name and cuisine) or by recipe ID.
